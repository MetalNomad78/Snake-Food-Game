- Developed a Snake Food game, allowing users to take control of the snake's movements and utilized Raylib to incorporate graphics.
- To accumulate points, the snake needs to consume treats scattered randomly across the game environment, promoting its growth.
- The game concludes when the snake bites itself or makes contact with the boundary, resulting in the "GAME OVER" state on the screen.
